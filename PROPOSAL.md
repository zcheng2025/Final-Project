Title: Transition State Sorter

Description: In nearly every chemical reaction, reactants gain energy then release energy as products are formed. Throughout this process, the reactants reach an energy "peak" known as a transition state. This highly active (and unstable) state details key information about the reaction including how energetically "costly" it is and what configuration the reactants are in as they being to form products. My program will be able to find the most energetically likely transition state given a list of potential transition states. It will also be able to detail the percentage by which that transition state is the most likely. The list of transition states will be in the form of a folder of several files that contain both the transition state geometries in addition to the transition state energies.

Goals: My immediate goals for the next week are to set up the code necessary to read out transition state files in addition to setting up the code necessary to do some correctional calculations on said files in order to make their energies more accurate.
