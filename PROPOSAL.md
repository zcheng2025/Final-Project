Title: Transition State Sorter

Description: In nearly every chemical reaction, reactants gain energy then release energy as products are formed. Throughout this process, the reactants reach an energy "peak" known as a transition state. This highly active (and unstable) state details key information about the reaction including how energetically "costly" it is and what configuration the reactants are in as they being to form products. My program will be able to find the most energetically likely transition state given a list of potential transition states. It will also be able to detail the percentage by which that transition state is the most likely.
